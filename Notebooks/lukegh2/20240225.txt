The design doc is finished up, and we have our design review tomorrow morning. The only piece of the design that I think
still isn't really concretely decided upon is the implementation of the memory module, that being whether or not 
we should use the sram chip we found a few weeks ago or if we should instead use an SD card. I'm personally leaning towards
and SD card, especially because it will allow us to test things without having to get internet working first,
and it allows internet to be cut from teh design completely if we can't get it to work. Futhermore, the SD card is 
stable memory, meaning when we want to power this thing off it an get powered off compeltely, saving valuable battery
life. An SD card may take a little bit more power to read from and write to though, but the 3DS did it and it just had a
battery so we should be fine. Honestly the more I think about it the more impressive it is that they got 3D graphics
to run so well on that little thing with 2 backlit screens. Anyway the schematic is being worked on, and is progressing well.
Thankfully nothing on this board is that crazy, and most things can be plotted out at least without having to decide
on the memory thing. Hopefully we can ask the professor tomorrow on his opinion and go from there.
