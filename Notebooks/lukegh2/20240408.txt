Worked a lot on the file format of the SD card.

There will be 3 metadata text files for the flashcard set

newstatus.txt:

stores whether or not a flashcard has been seen by the user yet, or is 'new'. Important because
a limited number of new cards may be seen per day and new cards are prioritized in the total daily card limit.

is just a string of ones and zeros. Example contents:

11111111111111100000000000000000000

the xth digit is 1 if the xth card in the set has been seen, 0 if it is new.


learnstatus.txt:

stores how well the user has learned each card. Important because it affects the number of days until a card should
be reviewed.

Is a string of digits from 0 to 9. Example contents:

77786787676565564356433443332211100

the xth digit tells how well the user knows the xth card in the set. 0 for not at all, 9 for mastery.

revstatus.txt:

tells how many days/practice sessions remain until a card will be reviewed. 

Is a string of 2 digit numbers. Numbers less than 10 will have a leading 0. Example contents:

232018171819180917061314161118091607200110170605070303010000

the 2*xth and 2*x+1th digit tell the days until review for the xth card. 

Psudocode for SD card initialization:

if newstatus.txt exists:
	read newstatus.txt
else:
	create newstatus.txt initialized to zeros
	read newstatus.txt

if revstatus.txt exists:
	read revstatus.txt
else:
	create revstatus.txt initialized to 00s		//revstatus is only considered for cards that are NOT new
	read revstatus.txt		

if learnstatus.txt exists:
	read learnstatus.txt
else:
	create learnstatus.txt initialized to zeros
	read learnstatus.txt

Will continue with runtime code soon.
