Began working on main runtime code. Making some small changes to the flowchart from the design document.

1. All references to SRAM of course replaced with SD card. Very happy we made this change.
2. Setting the days until review not as a card is finished for the day, but all at once once all cards are finished
3. Update the learn status of a card after every answer. Decrement if user is not confident, increment if they are.

It's going very smoothly. Will add the updated flowchart into the notebook.

Right now, the code is capable of the following:

1. Check for existing flashcard metadata, create it if not present
2. Decide of which flashcards to be 'active cards' for the day. Proritize new cards to a certain limit, then
   fill in up to another limit with seen cards up for review
3. Choose cards from the active list randomly
4. Respond to user button press to both flip cards and give feedback
5. update learn status based on the user responses
6. Recognize when all cards have been answered correctly and wrap up
7. update new status for newly seen cards, set the correct days until review for cards looked at today
8. decrement days until review for all other cards in the set.
