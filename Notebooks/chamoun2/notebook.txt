- Added some pinouts to ESP32, want to get started ASAP on routing the hierarchy from each modules with each other
- Added buttons to schematic including debouncing
Generally speaking ESP32 allows any pinout as long as there is no interference with the strapping. 
We just need to assign the pins accordingly when we program the MCU
